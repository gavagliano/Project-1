    <h1>Late Night Cafes in Manhattan</h1>
    <p>Working from home can be so boring. We all need a change of scenery every now and then.
    After the pandemic cut restaurant hours and devastated New York City’s café industry, it seemed impossible to find the perfect café that was also open late at night. And this is supposed to be the city that never sleeps. </p>
    <p>If you’re a late-night worker in NYC, you need a workspace that has wifi and preferably some food. You also want a cozy space with nice art and décor because you are in New York (sorry, Starbucks is not good enough).</p>
    <p>There are 47 amazing cafes in Manhattan that are open past 10pm. Out of those 47 cafes, 24 are open past midnight. And they all offer an array of food and decor to suit your needs. </p>

    </script>
    <p>Half of the cafes open past midnight are in Lower Manhatthan, with a large concentration in East Village and West Village. In fact, three cafes are on the same street - Caffe Reggio, Olive Tree Cafe, and La Lanterna di Vittorio.  </p>

    <p>Younger people and late-night revelers hang out more in the downtown areas, which helps those cafes stay in business during the late hours. Many prominent universities are also downtown, such as New York University (NYU) and The New School, and we all know late-night studying is a popular pastime in college. Only one late-night café was found in the residential Upper East Side and zero were in Harlem. </p>
    <p>New York City's cafe culture is certainly not dead, but you might need to head downtown for a wider variety to choose from if you enjoy a late-night cup of joe. Or you can try Brooklyn. </p>
